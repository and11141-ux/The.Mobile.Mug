        <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>The Mobile Mug was founded by <strong>Emily Anderson</strong>, a passionate barista who loves bringing artisan
            coffee directly to the community. Built on love, caffeine, and adventure, The Mobile Mug travels to local events,
            markets, and neighborhoods to deliver handcrafted drinks with a smile.</p>

        <h3>Mission Statement</h3>
            <p>We believe coffee should be an experience — warm, welcoming, and crafted with care. Our mission is to make
            specialty coffee more accessible and fun for everyone.</p>
